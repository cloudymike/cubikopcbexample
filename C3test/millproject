mirror-axis=1 # Mirror the design to X. Required for the back side
# voronoi=1 # (optional) Instead of cutting straight traces, cut the board only in the places that shouldn't connect with each other. Produces very weird boards but it's quite fast and optimal

# Milling - Trace engraving
zwork=-0.10mm # MODIFIED (0.07mm) Depth of engraving - did  quite a lot of testing and it seems 0.07 is quite consistent
mill-feed=100 # Modified (600) How fast to go, in mm/min - maybe go a bit faster?
mill-speed=10000 # How fast to rotate the spindle in RPM
mill-diameters=0.176mm # MODIFIED(0.30mm)Caluclated by pcb_mill_calc.py - 0.30mm for 0.2mm 60 degree endmill
